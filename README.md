Under the folder X-1_sizing_code/glider_sizing_code/x64/Release/ there should be a .exe file that you can run. Once running, a text window and a graphics window will display, the graphics window will display a chart with the chart contents listed at the top of the window (ie. a title of "Aspect ratio" means that each cell in the table is the aspect ratio of some glider, so that each cell represents a glider). The table horizontal axis is span, ranging from 19.5 to 30.5 cm, the vertical is chord and ranges from 2.1cm to 7cm. Use the up and down arrows to navigate between charts and left click on any cell to get the data of the glider at that cell outputed on the text terminal. Also creates a bunch of txt files from the charts once the program closes, the txt files are in csv format and I think are transposed as well.
